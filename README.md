## 🏢 Business Context
**Kimia Farma** operates an extensive network of branches across Indonesia. Managing performance across diverse regions requires more than just looking at total sales; it demands a deep dive into profitability margins, regional efficiency, and customer experience consistency.

As a **Big Data Analytics Intern**, the primary challenge was to unify four disparate datasets (*Transactions, Inventory, Branch Profiles, Product Catalog*) to answer critical business questions:
- Which regions are the true profit engines vs. high-volume but low-margin areas?
- Are there branches where customers love the store but hate the checkout experience?
- How has revenue trended post-pandemic (2020–2023)?

## 🎯 Objectives
1.  **Data Engineering:** Build a robust ETL pipeline in **Google BigQuery** to create a unified "Single Source of Truth" analysis table.
2.  **Advanced Modeling:** Implement complex business logic, specifically **tiered gross profit margins** (ranging from 10% to 30% based on product price brackets).
3.  **Visualization:** Develop an interactive **Looker Studio** dashboard for real-time monitoring of KPIs.
4.  **Strategic Analysis:** Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize branch operations and regional strategy.

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations
Based on the analysis of **672K+ transactions** and **346B IDR** in revenue:

### 1. 🗺️ Geographic Concentration Risk
- **Finding:** **Jawa Barat** is the undisputed engine, contributing ~30% of Total Revenue and ~30% of Total Profit. Meanwhile, Eastern Indonesia shows presence but negligible profitability.
- **Recommendation:** Defend the Jawa Barat supply chain aggressively. Conduct a "Profitability Audit" for Eastern branches to decide between optimization or restructuring.

### 2. ⚠️ The "Operational Gap"
- **Finding:** Scatter plot analysis revealed critical outliers (e.g., **Tarakan, Bekasi**) where **Branch Ratings are high (>4.4)** but **Transaction Ratings are critically low (<3.99)**.
- **Recommendation:** Immediate operational audit of checkout processes in these specific cities. Customers like the store but dislike the buying experience (queues, POS speed, staff interaction).

### 3. 📉 Revenue Stagnation
- **Finding:** Revenue peaked in 2022 but dipped back to 2021 levels in 2023.
- **Recommendation:** Investigate Q3-Q4 2023 drivers. Shift focus to promoting higher-tier products (>300k IDR) which carry 25-30% margins, rather than relying solely on volume growth of low-margin items.
